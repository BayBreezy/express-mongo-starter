# Express Starter Template for MongoDB

Ok, so I got tired of rewriting the same template and functions over and over again.

So I created this thing.

Just copy whatever parts will help

## TODO

1. Create your `.env` file from the example
1. Add the values for the variables
1. Run `npm install`
1. to start developing `nodemon index.js` OR `npm run dev`
